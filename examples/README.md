# Examples

This folder will host focused examples built on top of the main firmware:

- `basic_fps_logger/` – Minimal camera capture loop (Sanity Check)
- `color_blob_tracking/` – track a colored object using simple HSV thresholding
- `roi_cropping/` – demonstrate region-of-interest extraction and downsampling

Each example will include:

- Short README
- Configuration notes
- Steps to build and flash

> **Note:** For a demonstration of the advanced Computer Vision pipeline (ROI, Blob Detection), please see the **Host Simulator** in the `simulation/` folder. It demonstrates how to configure and run the full pipeline C++ class.

# Examples

This folder will host focused examples built on top of the main firmware:

- `color_blob_tracking/` – track a colored object using simple HSV thresholding
- `roi_cropping/` – demonstrate region-of-interest extraction and downsampling

Each example will include:

- Short README
- Configuration notes
- Steps to build and flash
